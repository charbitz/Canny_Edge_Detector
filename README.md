# Description
***This repo contains the final project of the course **Digital Image Processing** of the 8th semester. The purpose of this project was the implementation of Canny's Edge detector.***

In addition, in order to check the performance of this Edge Detector, a matlab preloaded library of Canny Edge detetor was used for comparison.

## Files explanation:

In code files, there are:
* code.m 	 : the main script, in which there is the main pipeline of the project.The comparison with Edge detector of MATLAB was also included.
* my_canny.m 	 : the script, in which there is the implemetation of the Canny Edge Detector.
* matlab_canny.m : the script, in which there is the pipeline for the MATLAB's library for Canny Edge Detection.

In image files, there are:
* Images  : the directory with the testing images.
* results : the directory with some screenshot results for every testing image.
